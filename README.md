# Development Suspended

This project is no longer updated.  The active version of Lampost is now on Gitlab:

[lampost_lib](https://gitlab.com/avezel/lampost_lib)  
[lampost_mud](https://gitlab.com/avezel/lampost_mud)  
[lampost_ui](https://gitlab.com/avezel/lampost-ui)  

These "current" versions do not have full support for the angular.js client.  Instead they use a React.js/mobx based client.
My development efforts are now focused on building a non-MUD game using the Lampost framework, so there will not be a React.js MUD
client/editor in the near future.  Accordingly if you need a MUD UI you are limited to using these Github versions of the code, or
of course, I would welcome someone else expanding the lampost_ui project to include full MUD support.

As always, please contact me at <geoffrey@avezel.com> with any questions or ideas.
